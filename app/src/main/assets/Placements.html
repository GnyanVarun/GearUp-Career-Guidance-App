<p>One of the things that will instantly set you apart from the crowd and get you noticed is your resume. We suggest you spend a fair amount of time writing your resume. Do not just fill out a preset template. Your resume needs to be customized according to your application for the company and job profile.</p>
<p>A resume made for a profile of a civil site engineer needs to be different from a summary made for a profile of a billing engineer.</p>
<p> Do thorough research about the job profile and the company. Talk to your Seniors or friends, or acquaintances working in that company and take their help. Most companies have a preferred format of resume.</p>
<p>Have your resume(s) reviewed by your friends, peers, and placement officers. Take their feedback and make necessary changes to your resume. Your resume is an indispensable tool. It needs to be correctly structured and formatted. Use simple language, check multiple times to make sure there are no errors, do not use fancy fonts or colors, and make sure your resume layout is clear. Check these accessible resume formats for engineering job seekers.</p>
<h3> Know about the companies </h3>
<p>Every college has multiple companies coming every year for campus recruitment. Find out which construction companies visit your college for placements from your placement cell and maintain a tracking sheet for those companies.</p>
<p>Write down the dates when they’re organizing the recruitment drive in your college, their official website address, links to their social media channels, and a brief description of the company.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a company might terminate their visit, and instead of them, some other companies’ visits might get scheduled. Therefore, knowing about every company that’s going to visit your company helps in such situations. You can write down their details in brief on the track sheet you’re maintaining.</p>
<p>Now you must do extensive research on these companies and learn everything you can about them. Here are some things that you should know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Company History</li>
<li>Founder and present CEO</li>
<li>Products and Services they offer</li>
<li>Company Location</li>
<li>Major news about the company</li>
<li>Major Achievements</li>
<li>Competitors (other significant players in the industry)</li>
<li>Business segment</li>
<li>Market Challenges and trends</li>
</ul>
<p>Though almost every company holds presentations before the interviews, you must read about them on their website and social media channels. Use your networks, and if any of your seniors are working in the company, ask them about the recruitment process, interview, etc.</p>
<p>When you’re given a chance to ask them questions after the presentation, don’t hesitate. Ask them about the job profile, the qualities they are looking for in their prospective employees, a typical day at the job, and something unique you noticed about them during your research or the presentation. So you must pay attention during the presentation.</p>
<h3> Know your Strengths </h3>
<p>This is what recruiters will be looking for. It is one thing to clear your exam with excellent marks, but it is another thing to be able to know your stuff at the drop of a hat. So, you have to know about your education, and you should talk about it whenever asked about it.</p>
<p>It also helps to have a favorite subject. It becomes easier to learn and even recall. So, if you have a favorite issue, make sure you are an expert on it because it is likely that you will be asked about it during placements.</p>
<h3> Aptitude Tests </h3>
<p>You will be taking an aptitude test set by the company. And since you know about it, you can prepare by taking online aptitude tests. There are many websites with strict aptitude tests that can help you get the hang of aptitude tests and do well. Use your free time to do these freely available tests.</p>
<p>You can look for tests based on your educational discipline and start preparing. For example, if you are an engineering student, there are aptitude tests for engineers. If you are a management student, you can look for management aptitude tests. And these tests are pretty easy to find online.</p>
<h3> Write & Speak Well </h3>
<p>Work on your English speaking and writing skills. In India, English is the official language of business communication. Therefore, to increase your chances of being selected as a candidate, work on your English writing and speaking skills. Recruiters will test both of these during your interview. </p>
<p>Always try to converse in English with your friends and family. Read a lot of books, magazines, and newspapers. This will also help you increase your vocabulary. Also, get into the practice of writing a journal. Many talented candidates even get rejected owing to poor communication skills, so take this seriously.</p>
<h3> Brush up your Technical Knowledge </h3>
<p>If you are getting educated in a technical discipline, be sure to brush up on your technical knowledge and skills. In campus placements interviews, there is a lot of importance placed on technical skills, and you will be mostly grilled about your technical knowledge.</p>
<p>Keep reading and updating your technical knowledge. Practical work is the best way to do this. More than anything else, this is what recruiters are concerned with, and if you can display your technical knowledge and skills, you are bound to get selected for a job.</p>
<h3> Mock Interviews </h3>
<p>One of the most nerve-wracking parts of the placement process is the one-on-one interviews. Campus placements are probably the first time you are facing an interview. Therefore, it is pretty natural to be nervous. But there is a way you can deal with your nerves and do well in the discussion – mock interviews.</p>
<p>Many colleges conduct mock interview exercises as a way to help their students prepare for placements. Make sure you are a part of them. You can also practice mock interviews with your friends as a means to prepare. This will genuinely help you. Kindly check this practice test to brush up on your technical skills.</p>
<h3>Develop Marketable Skills</h3>
<p>In the competitive professional world, just knowing about your subject is not enough; you need to have other forms of skills and knowledge that will project you as a well-rounded candidate that is worth employing.</p>
<p>Presentation skills, email writing skills, public speaking skills may be expected from an MBA student, but imagine an engineer having these skills.</p>
<p>Similarly, if an MBA student knows programming languages and coding, it will instantly make them stand out from the rest. These are the skills you should acquire to give yourself a better chance.</p>
<h3>Improve General Knowledge</h3>
<p>General knowledge matters a lot. If you have good general knowledge, you will automatically do well in the interview and group discussions. Good general understanding also portrays you as someone aware of your surroundings and knows what is happening in the industry.</p>
<p>To increase your general knowledge, you need to make use of the internet. Read up on all the latest national and international news and news related to the industry you hope to work in. Also, read the newspaper. Get into the habit of it. It will increase your general knowledge and increase your chances of getting hired during campus recruitments.</p>
<h3> Tips to Crack the Campus Placement Interview </h3>
<ul>
<li>Start by preparing specifically for the companies you are sitting for. Companies want the candidates to be proficient in at least one subject or profile. Pick the subject of your choice and learn to demonstrate your knowledge.</li>
<li>Check the reviews about the interview process of the companies on Glassdoor or any other job portal. Most of them paint an accurate picture of what you are going to face.</li>
<li>Read about the interview process of other candidates and try to gain some insights into which subjects the interviewers of that particular company most focus on.</li>
<li>Google for past placement papers of the company you will be sitting for next. It seems unimportant but let me tell you a secret.</li>
<li>Most of the companies have a standard set of questions that they repeat throughout the whole Placement session wherever they go, try to get a general idea about the type of questions they ask.</li>
<li>Also, call a few seniors( who are working at the company you are trying to get into) and ask about their own experiences. If you have a good network of friends, it won’t be hard to find a senior who guides you.</li>
<li>Do not be late for your interview round. Nothing pisses an HR person more than a candidate appearing late.</li>
<li>Look confident but not appear rude. No matter how good they are, most people sometimes just cannot handle themselves during their interviews. Just try to relax.</li>
<li>Work on your communication skills from now itself. Learn to answer as briefly as possible. If you are nervous, do a few mock interviews with your friends.</li>
<li>Do not blatantly lie as these guys were themselves, students, earlier and have been part of the interview process throughout their life. Questions like “Why do you have this much percentage/CGPA?” ” Why do you want to work for our company?” “Where do you want to see yourself in 5 years”  are commonplace, and it would help you a great deal if you are prepared for these beforehand.</li>
<li>Do try not to mumble/bluff through your technical rounds too. If you are confident, then answer. Otherwise, ask politely in terms of ” I am not exactly sure of the answer, but can I tell what I know about the topic” and try to make an educated guess if you are permitted.</li>
<li>You never know if the Interviewer is planning a stressful interview. If the Interviewer appears rude, also keep your calm and do not lose focus.</li>
<li>Read the ” About Us” page on the company website and listen carefully during the company presentations generally held before the Interview process.</li>
<li>When you are allowed to ask questions, do not hesitate and show how much you are already familiar with the company and your job profile. Good questions to ask will be about a typical day at the job, the interviewer’s job profile, what qualities they look for in a prospective employee, or something unique you noticed during the presentation.</li>
<li>Do not get demotivated if you cannot answer all the questions and not panic under any circumstances. Sometimes Interviewers ask hard questions.</li>
<li>Sometimes they ask all sorts of questions that are probably too hard to answer. It is just to know if you are well prepared and interested beyond what is taught at your college.</li>
<li>Do bring 2-3 copies of your resume. You do not want to sit there and find out you gave the only copy of your resume to the HR lady and do not have something to show to your interviewer.</li>
<li>After you are done with the interview, do graciously ask for their feedback after the process, even if you are not selected. It will help you perform better for the upcoming companies. If they refuse, then walk out.</li>
<li>Do not dress casually and cut your fingernails. During one of my Interview Rounds, I was asked if I considered the company below my level as I had dressed like a Hobo.</li>
<li>Write about your projects on your CV. Write briefly and do not give it all away to explain to the interviewer later on during the actual interview and impress him. If you are any good, you can easily divert the whole interview process towards your projects and questions based on them. But do prepare in advance and read about your projects thoroughly.</li>
<li>There is no excuse for failing to explain whatever you did during the time of the interview. I had three technical projects and 4-5 nontechnical ones, including 2 Study Oriented Projects. I would focus on the technical ones during the coding profiles and the others during the rest.</li>
<li>Do not talk too much. Be to the point and do not ramble on during interviews. Do not try to impress your Interviewees by being quick to answer their questions and not listening properly, or giving a wrong answer.</li>
<li>If you have some doubt, just say that you are not entirely sure of the answer but would still like to attempt the question and then follow up with the best logical explanation you can give, even if you do not know if it is the exact answer.</li>
<li>Prepare different resumes for different profiles. The summary you make for a site engineer profile will have to be different from that billing engineer profile.</li>
<li>If it is a telephonic interview or online interview,  fix the slot during which you can give your best. Most people in college only get up during the afternoon and are most proficient during late evenings. If possible, try to arrange the interview according to that.</li>
<li>You can also check the various placement preparation sites for engineering students.</li>
</ul>
