<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Agricultural engineers attempt to solve agricultural problems concerning power supplies, the efficiency of machinery, the use of structures and facilities, pollution and environmental issues, and the storage and processing of agricultural products.</p>
<hr>
<h3>What do they do?</h3>
<p>Agricultural engineers typically do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use computer software to design equipment, systems, or structures.</li>
<li>Modify environmental factors that affect animal or crop production, such as airflow in a barn or runoff patterns on a field.</li>
<li>Test equipment to ensure its safety and reliability.</li>
<li>Oversee construction and production operations.</li>
<li>Plan and work together with clients, contractors, consultants, and other engineers to ensure effective and desirable outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Key skills required</h3>
<p>Agricultural engineers should possess the following specific qualities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analytical skills. Because agricultural engineers sometimes design systems that are part of a larger agricultural or environmental system, they must be able to propose solutions that interact well with other workers, machinery and equipment, and the environment.</li>
<li>Listening skills. Agricultural engineers must listen to and seek out information from clients, workers, and other professionals working on a project. Furthermore, they must be able to address the concerns of those who will be using the systems and solutions they design.</li>
<li>Math skills. Agricultural engineers use the principals of calculus, trigonometry, and other advanced topics in math for analysis, design, and troubleshooting in their work.</li>
<li>Problem-solving skills. Agricultural engineers work on problems affecting many different aspects of agricultural production, from designing safer equipment for food processing to water erosion. To solve these problems, agricultural engineers must be able to apply general principles of engineering to new circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Educational requirements</h3>
<p>Agricultural engineers must have a bachelor’s degree, preferably in agricultural engineering or biological engineering. Bachelor’s degree programs typically are 4-year programs that include classroom, laboratory, and field studies in areas such as science, mathematics, and engineering principles.</p>
