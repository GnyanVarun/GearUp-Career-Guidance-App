<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>An investment analyst is a financial professional with expertise in evaluating financial and investment information, typically for the purpose of making buy, sell and hold recommendations for securities. Brokerage firms, investment advisors and mutual fund companies hire investment analysts to prepare investment research for multiple purposes.</p>

<h3>What do they do?</h3>
<p>An investment analyst continuously collects and interprets data, such as company financial statements, price developments, currency adjustments, and yield fluctuations. The information gathering also includes macro developments, such as following a country's political sea changes, climate change and the impact of natural disasters, and emerging industries and service sectors.</p>

<h3>Key skills required</h3>
<p>An analytical mind with a keen sense of mathematical patterns and correlations is the most important tool for an investment analyst. The ability to detect trends early, and using niche expertise to find ways to capitalize on them, is what makes the investment analyst valuable to the company.</p>
<p>Great attention to detail and the ability to make sound judgment calls under time pressure are also important skills. An investment analyst must be able to respond quickly with new recommendations when sudden market changes occur.</p>

<h3>Educational requirements</h3>
<p>An undergraduate student typically majors in finance, computer science, biology, physics or engineering and takes courses in business, economics, accounting and math. A master of business administration (MBA) is also often preferred for senior investment analysts. Investment analysts may also seek Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) securities licensing which requires corporate sponsorship. Securities licenses often required by investment analysts include the Series 7 general securities representative license and the Series 63 uniform securities agent license. FINRA licenses are typically associated with the selling of specific securities as a firmâ€™s registered representative. Investment analysts may also seek to obtain the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) certification.</p>
