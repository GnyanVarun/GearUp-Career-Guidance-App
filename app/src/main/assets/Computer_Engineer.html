<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Computer engineers work to improve the capabilities of computers and find new ways to apply computers to other machines and systems. These engineers generally need knowledge of computer hardware and software and combine many concepts from the fields of electrical engineering and computer science. These engineers may work with computer hardware, software, computer architecture, programming, and computer-based systems.</p>

<h3>What do they do?</h3>
<p>Computer engineers may be responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building computers and computer-based systems.</li>
<li>Working in teams with software developers and other IT professionals.</li>
<li>Testing new hardware/software.</li>
<li>Adjusting new designs as needed.</li>
<li>Upgrading equipment and software as needed.</li>
<li>Researching new technologies.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Key Skills required</h3>
<ul>
<li>Analyze information to determine, recommend, and plan layout, including type of computers and peripheral equipment modifications.</li>
<li>Analyze user needs and recommend appropriate hardware.</li>
<li> Build, test and modify product prototypes, using working models or theoretical models constructed using computer simulation.</li>
<li>Confer with engineering staff and consult specifications to evaluate interface between hardware and software and operational and performance requirements of overall system.</li>
<li>Design and develop computer hardware and support peripherals, including central processing units (CPUs), support logic, microprocessors, custom integrated circuits, and printers and disk drives.</li>
<li> Evaluate factors such as reporting formats required, cost constraints, and need for security restrictions to determine hardware configuration.</li>
<li>Monitor functioning of equipment and make necessary modifications to ensure system operates in conformance with specifications.</li>
<li>Specify power supply requirements and configuration, drawing on system performance expectations and design specifications.</li>
</ul>
