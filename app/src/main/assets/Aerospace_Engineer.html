<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Aerospace engineers design primarily aircraft, spacecraft, satellites, and missiles.Aerospace engineers are employed in industries whose workers design or build aircraft, missiles, systems for national defense, or spacecraft. Aerospace engineers are employed primarily in manufacturing, analysis and design, research and development, and the federal government.</p>

<h3>What do they do?</h3>
<p>Aerospace Engineers are responsible for directing the manufacturing and testing of the prototypes they design. It is up to them to determine if proposed projects are technically possible and safe, ensuring the quality of all projects. They are involved from start to finish in their projects, performing a number of duties:
<ul>
<li>Decide if a project’s operations are safe.</li>
<li>Evaluate the designs to ensure they meet customer satisfaction, engineering principles and environment regulations.</li>
<li>Create the foundation for manufacture methods, quality standards and date of delivery.</li>
<li>Inspect malfunctioning products to determine the source and solution of the problem.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Key skills required</h3>
<ul>
<li> Aerodynamics : Good Basics in Fluid Mechanics - Covering Aerodynamics, Boundary Layer Theory, ability to use classic equations.</li>
<li>Propulsion : Basic Thermodynamics, Gas Dynamics, Cycles, Isentropic Equations,Ability to use simple analytical equations to perform hand calculations.</li>
<li>For the structures part:Good basics in strength of materials, design of structures and simple mechanical elements,again ability to look at a problem and simplify it to basic load and moment diagrams,hand calculations.</li>
<li>For Avionics part:Control Theory and Flight Dynamics and grip in math concepts like , coordinate geometry , algebra, control theory, calculus is a must.</li>
</ul>
<p>So being good at one out out any four domains in aero should be able to land you in a job at the first place…. But also CAD (SOLID MODELING) , and CFD or FEA skills are a must these days…. Good knowledge of basic engineering drawings is preferable if you want to end up in real engineering job rather than one which asks only MOUSE-CLICKING.</p>
<p>Just remember that, in industry we do use all the basic and simple equations like Bernoulli’s Eqn, Isentropic Equations, Bending Equations, Basic Stress Equations etc. on the job once in a while.</p>

<h3>Educational requirements</h3>
<p>Aerospace Engineers require at least a Bachelor's degree to enter into the field, typically in aerospace engineering. Some university programs offer 5-year programs that allow students to earn a bachelor's and master's degree at the same time. All Aerospace Engineering programs are accredited by the ABET.

Though entry-level positions do not require licensure, more advanced Aerospace Engineering programs will likely demand a Professional Engineer (PE) license. Though the requirements vary by state, most require an accredited engineering degree, work experience, and passing performance on both the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam and the Professional Engineering Exam.

Acquiring a managerial position in Aerospace Engineering often requires extensive work experience and shadowing a senior Aerospace Engineer.</p>
