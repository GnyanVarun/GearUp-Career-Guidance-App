<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Automotive engineers design the systems and mechanisms of cars. These professionals ensure that automotive designs and systems conform to budgeted quality and cost specifications. Similar to other types of mechanical engineers, automotive engineers analyze potential problems in design and work to solve those problems, design and retest prototypes of cars and car parts, and oversee the manufacturing of automotives. Computers are a big part of how automotive engineers do their jobs.</p>

<h3>Educational requirements</h3>
<p>An automotive engineer’s career training begins with a four-year bachelor’s degree from an accredited college or university. This is generally the basic requirement for entry-level jobs in the career. While pursing their bachelor’s degree, students take classes in a range of fields, including physics, mathematics, design and computer science. Certain programs also require core courses in the humanities, in areas such as English or philosophy. The first two years typically consist of foundational classes in math and science, while the last two or three years consist of more engineering-specific courses. Aspiring automotive engineers should pursue a degree in mechanical engineering or a related engineering field.</p>
