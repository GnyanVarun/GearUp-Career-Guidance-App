<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>A network administrator is responsible for keeping an organization’s computer network up-to-date and operating as intended. Any company or organization that uses multiple computers or software platforms needs a network admin to coordinate and connect the different systems. Seems simple enough—but there’s another common IT job title that is commonly confused: systems administrator.</p>

<h3>What do they do?</h3>
<p> A network administrator will vary considerably depending on the organization they work for. Some work as jack-of-all-trades generalists who cover everything from hardware setup to troubleshooting servers while others have a much narrower focus.In environments where administrators play more specialized roles, network administrators tend to focus more on how computers interact with one another. This often includes configuring an organization’s local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN) and other elements of a network system. Systems administrators, on the other hand, work more directly with computer hardware and software, including installation, maintenance, data recovery and training on best practices.</p>
