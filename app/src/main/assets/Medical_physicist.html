<h3>Educational requirements</h3>
<p>To become a medical physicist a good degree in physics, applied science, computation, mathematics or engineering is necessary. However, for positions with the NHS, each NHS trust decides which degrees are relevant. A postgraduate qualification can be beneficial. Read our article on scientific postgraduate study to explore your different options.Research work, hospital laboratory placements and/or relevant experience gained using similar scientific and analytical techniques can also be useful.</p>
