<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Web Producers are responsible for what you see when you open a website, meaning that they ensure that the content of a website is optimized for a user experience. Web Producers are in charge of arranging, editing, and many times even creating content for websites.Web content can come in many forms, including music, video, flash, and print. Sometimes, as a Web Producer, you'll specialize just in one of these areas, while other times you act more as a generalist. Whichever way you choose, your tasks go far beyond slapping up a chunk of text on a screen: You are in charge of styling the content to create the voice and character of a site.</p>
