<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>A company secretary's job is primarily on recording minutes during a board meeting. Company secretaries perform various administrative tasks in a company as they are tasked to keep records of the company's decisions and disseminate them to other board members. They are in charge of regulating the company in terms of its compliance with the regulatory and statutory requirements. If a company secretary finds an area of the company that needs improvement, it is also their job to advise the board of directors that will allow them to fulfill their goal as a company. They are a very important member of the company because they oversee the corporation's processes and decisions as well as counseling them for further development.</p>
