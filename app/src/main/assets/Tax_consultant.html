<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Tax consultants are financial experts who assist clients with tax issues. This can include preparing tax returns, acting as a representative, or giving specialist advice. The ways in which a consultant operates, such as their fees and their licensing requirements, can vary greatly in different jurisdictions.</p>

<h3>What do they do?</h3>
<p>Tax consultants work for public accounting firms, law offices, financial consulting firms and many even have their own independent tax preparation and consultation businesses. In all settings, tax consultants can be expected to perform duties that include:</p>

<li>Conducting research on tax laws</li>
<li>Strategizing with clients to minimize tax liability</li>
<li>Communicating with clients to explain tax issues</li>

<h3>Educational requirements</h3>
<p>Tax consultants generally hold bachelorâ€™s degrees in accounting, finance or a related field; however, because no formal certification is required, individuals often take on advisory roles after years of experience in another tax related profession. Ultimately, professionals with both formal education and tax experience are best positioned for these careers. Obtaining licensure as a CPA demonstrates the formal education and professional experience needed to support a future as a successful tax consultant. However, Internal Revenue Service employees may have years of experience, yet no formal education and be very well suited for advisory roles allowing them to obtain positions as tax consultants because of their relevant experience alone.</p>
