<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Financial consultants work with companies or individuals to plan for their financial futures by offering information and guidance on topics that include taxes, investments and insurance decisions. Often called financial advisors, these consultants work closely with clients to offer personalized financial advice. Consultants may also direct the buying and selling of stocks and bonds for their clients. Some consultants work for consulting firms that focus on the financial needs of specific businesses or industries.</p>

<h3>What do they do?</h3>
<p>Consultants meet personally with clients to assess their financial situation to present a financial plan that includes both short- and long-term financial goals. Consultants help clients with financial planning decisions for retirement, education, day-to-day expenses and investments. They meet regularly with clients to assess how life changes such as marriage, job change or the birth of a child will affect the client's financial plan. In addition, many consultants are licensed to buy and sell financial products such as insurance policies, stocks and bonds.</p>
<p>Consultants spend much of their time reaching out to prospective clients and building a strong customer base. This means consultants often travel or work non-traditional hours to meet with clients in their homes or businesses. Consultants may also offer financial planning classes or seminars to reach out to potential clients.</p>

<h3>Educational requirements</h3>
<p>Like many other professionals working in the finance and banking industries, financial consultants usually possess at least a bachelor's degree in any subject though most choose majors related to business. Some investment firms allow certain individuals that have extensive experience in sales or entrepreneurship to work as a financial consultant without completing an undergraduate degree. Along with a bachelor's degree, a number of financial consultants have graduate degrees, such as a Master of Business Administration.</p>
<p>Undergraduate degree programs in finance are widely available to students seeking careers as financial consultants. Depending on the programs offered by a specific institution of higher education, students can earn either a Bachelor of Arts or a Bachelor of Science in Finance. Some universities and community colleges offer associate's degrees in finance but the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) says that a bachelor's degree is the preferred minimum standard for employment as a financial consultant.</p>
