<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Civil engineers have a range of responsibilities related to building structures of any kind.They plan, build, maintain the projects working in the office and on-site.Civil engineers are responsible for creating plans, calculating budgets and completion time, testing environmental impact and materials.They also have to negotiate with government regulators, model parts with specific software, interact with architects, workers, and suppliers to keep things on track.</p>

<h3>What do they do?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Creating project plans, including costs and completion dates by using various data sources and site analysis.</li>
<li>Showcase the plan to government authorities to get approval and compliance.</li>
<li>Obtain materials and labor keeping up with costs, quality, reliability and adherence to industry standards.</li>
<li>Monitor the project to detect any potential mistakes and problems.</li>
<li>Work with other team members to finish the design and assemble the project.</li>
<li>Connect the project to the right infrastructure according to the safety codes and best practices.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key Skills required</h3>
<ul>
<li>Technical: Civil engineers need to be proficient in math and able to carry out complex mathematical modeling of physics of the structure.
They need to know how to use design and engineering software.</li>
<li>Collaboration: Civil engineers work with multiple professionals, manage workers, and report to bosses.
They have to get along with people of different backgrounds.</li>
<li>Communication: Civil engineers should communicate effectively whether they deal with drawing plans, relaying instructions, or making presentations.</li>

<h3>Educational requirements</h3>
<p>An entry-level civil engineer must earn a bachelor's degree in civil engineering or one of its specialties. The completed program must be accredited by ABET (formerly known as the Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology). The 4-year degree includes core academic coursework in math, statistics, engineering mechanics and systems, and fluid dynamics. These courses are structured to provide students with a mix of traditional classroom learning, fieldwork, and applied work in laboratories. Several programs also include co-ops, which allow students to gain relevant work experience while simultaneously pursuing their degree.</p>
