<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Financial planners help their clients develop short-term and long-term financial goals and develop strategies to accomplish those goals. They may work with young families, individuals nearing retirement, small business owners, or entrepreneurs. Because each client has unique goals, the financial planner must develop individual plans of action.</p>

<h3>What do they do?</h3>
<p>Financial planners counsel and advise their clients on investment opportunities and other major financial decisions, like purchasing a home, developing a budget, or paying down debt. They help plan for the future through insurance products and estate planning. They may also provide guidance on personal taxes, such as possible deductions or tax-advantaged investment opportunities.</p>

<h3>Educational requirements</h3>
<p>A bachelor's degree in a finance-related field is a typical starting point, but some firms also hire graduates in the humanities such as psychology majors. A financial planner requires the ability to build trust with clients, explain complex financial products in lay terms, and obtain client buy-in for a plan of action. Interpersonal skills are often considered more important than detailed knowledge of mutual funds and trading strategies.</p>
<p>A Master of Business Administration (MBA) might help a financial planner climb the corporate ladder toward a management position. Occasionally, you might see doctorates in finance-related fields among managers, but MBA holders are the most common.</p>
