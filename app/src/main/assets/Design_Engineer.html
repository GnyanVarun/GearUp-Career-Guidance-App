<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>A Design Engineer, or Product Engineer, is responsible for turning ideas for products into functional prototypes using efficient and affordable processes. Their duties include preparing design briefs that serve a particular purpose, researching possible production methods and use engineering software to refine and develop their product.</p>
<hr>
<h3>What do they do?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Assessing a design brief to gauge the design requirements.</li>
<li>Conducting and/or using research on user experience and needs, current market trends and general functionality.</li>
<li>Developing solutions that solve user problems.</li>
<li>Determining whether a design solution is user-friendly, cost-effective and environmentally friendly.</li>
<li>Creating multiple iterations of design prototypes using computer-aided design tools.</li>
<li>Conducting rigorous usability tests and modifying the product based on the test results.</li>
<li>Evaluating design solutions against industry standards and regulations.</li>
<li>Documenting the design process and presenting progress reports to all relevant stakeholders.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Key skills required</h3>
<ul>
<li>Advanced design skills.</li>
<li>Product-focused creative thinking.</li>
<li>In-depth knowledge of industry design principles.</li>
<li>Strong working knowledge of computer-aided design (CAD) or engineering software.</li>
<li>Impeccable attention to detail.</li>
<li>Excellent problem-solving skills.</li>

<h3>Educational requirements</h3>
<p>Design Engineer candidates should have at least a bachelor’s degree in design engineering, manufacturing engineering, product design engineering technology or other related fields. Some candidates may have a master’s degree in design engineering or another similar specialized field, which could indicate more advanced design knowledge and practical application of design principles. A candidate without a degree may have completed an apprenticeship or vocational training in product or manufacturing design engineering. Some candidates may also have one or multiple certificates in specific design engineer principles, technology or leadership.</p>
<p>Entry-level Design Engineer candidates likey have experience from internships or other practical learning opportunities completed during their undergraduate studies. Some may even have a few years of relevant experience in design engineering, product engineering or other relevant roles. A Design Engineer’s experience typically indicates a knowledge of interpreting design briefs and providing multiple iterations of a prototype based on the outlined requirements and a proven record of navigating complex projects. Candidates may also have experience using certain CAD software and other relevant technology as well.</p>
