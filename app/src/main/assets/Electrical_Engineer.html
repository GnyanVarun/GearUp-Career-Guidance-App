<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Electrical engineers develop and test electronic products and systems for a wide range of projects, from small-scale (e.g. household devices) to large-scale (e.g. electrical power systems). They operate in several disciplines, such as Power Engineering, Signal Processing, and Micro-electronics, based on their expertise.</p>

<h3>Educational requirements</h3>
<p>Earning a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering or a Bachelor of Engineering with a concentration in Electrical Engineering is a requirement for any prospective electrical engineer. A master's in electrical engineering is a must for anyone with greater career aspirations, and a doctorate might even be recommended. Most engineering programs require students to take a separate entrance exam; classes in math, physics, science and computer science will make up most of the course load. Most undergraduate electrical engineering degrees take four to five years to complete; master's-level programs take two years or more.</p>
