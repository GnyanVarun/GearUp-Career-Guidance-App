<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Chemical engineers apply the principles of chemistry, biology, physics, and math to solve problems that involve the production or use of chemicals, fuel, drugs, food, and many other products. They design processes and equipment for large-scale manufacturing, plan and test production methods and byproducts treatment, and direct facility operations.</p>
<hr>
<h3>What do they do?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Conduct research to develop new and improved manufacturing processes.</li>
<li>Establish safety procedures for those working with dangerous chemicals.</li>
<li>Develop processes for separating components of liquids and gases, or for generating electrical currents, by using controlled chemical processes.</li>
<li>Design and plan the layout of equipment.</li>
<li>Conduct tests and monitor the performance of processes throughout production.</li>
<li>Troubleshoot problems with manufacturing processes.</li>
<li>Evaluate equipment and processes to ensure compliance with safety and environmental regulations.</li>
<li>Estimate production costs for management.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key skills required</h3>
<p>Chemical engineers should also possess the following specific qualities:</p>
<ul>
<li><italic>Analytical skills</italic> Chemical engineers must be able to figure out why a particular design does not work as planned. They must be able to ask the right questions and then find answers that work.</li>
<li><italic>Creativity</italic>Chemical engineers must be able to explore new ways of applying engineering principles. They work to invent new materials, advanced manufacturing techniques, and new applications in chemical and biomedical engineering.</li>
<li><italic>Ingenuity</italic> Chemical engineers learn the broad concepts of chemical engineering, but their work requires them to apply those concepts to specific production problems.</li>
<li><italic>Interpersonal skills</italic>Chemical engineers must develop good working relationships with people in production because their role is to put scientific principles into practice in manufacturing industries.</li>
<li><italic>Math skills</italic>Chemical engineers use the principals of calculus and other advanced topics in mathematics for analysis, design, and troubleshooting in their work.</li>
<li><italic>Problem-solving skills</italic>In designing equipment and processes for manufacturing, these engineers strive to solve several problems at once, including such issues as workers’ safety and problems related to manufacturing and environmental protection. They must also be able to anticipate and identify problems to prevent losses for their employers, safeguard workers’ health, and prevent environmental damage.</li>
</ul>
